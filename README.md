# 0-Programmer

_NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - THE PROJECT HAS JUST STARTED, SO NOT MUCH IS BUILT YET - WATCH THIS SPACE_

0-Programmer is a simple application which allows you to edit the program pages of your Make Noise 0-Coast. The goal is to provide the functionality of the Make Noise Max4Live Page programmer, but in a standalone application. Simple as that :-)

The project has just started, so not much functionality exists yet. But here's what we'll do first:

* Make it possible to send some MIDI data to an interface by pressing a button. **[DONE]**
* Make it possible to enable/disable the 0-Coast arpeggiator. **[DONE]**
* Add end-2-end integration test: Simulate button press, verify that correct message is in buffer. **[DONE]**

Next steps:
* Initial User Guide
* Document general architecture
* Add remaining parameters
* Tests!
* Proper GUI Layout
* Graphics!

This project is built using the fantastic [PAMPLEJUCE](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template.
