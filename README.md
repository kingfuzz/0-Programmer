# 0-Programmer

0-Programmer is a simple application which allows you to edit the program pages of your Make Noise 0-Coast. The goal is to provide the functionality of the Make Noise Max4Live Page programmer, but in a standalone application. Simple as that :blush:

We currently support MacOS and an experimental, untested, Linux version. If there's any interest, supporting iOS and Windows could be considered.

## Usage
Find and download the app in the *Releases* section to the right :arrow_right: :arrow_right: :arrow_right:

To use the app, do as follows:
1. When running the app, you may need to right-click and select "open", as the app is not certified/notarized/whatever...
2. Connect your 0-Coast to a Midi Interface
3. Select that Midi Interface the 0-Programmer Options.
4. On the 0-Coast device, press and hold PGM_A to enter program pages.
3. Have fun!
