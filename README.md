# 0-Programmer

_NOTE: THIS IS A WORK IN PROGRESS - THE PROJECT HAS JUST STARTED, SO NOTHING IS BUILT YET - WATCH THIS SPACE_

0-Programmer is a simple application which allows you to edit the program pages of your Make Noise 0-Coast. The goal is to provide the functionality of the Make Noise Max4Live Page programmer, but in a standalone application. Simple as that :-)

The project has just started, so not much functionality exists yet. But here's what we'll do first:

* Make it possible to send some MIDI data to an interface by pressing a button.
* Make it possible to enable/disable the 0-Coast

This project is built using the fantastic [PAMPLEJUCE](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) template.
